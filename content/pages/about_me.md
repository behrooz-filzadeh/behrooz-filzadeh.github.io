##  What I Do

I'm a **Data & ML Engineer** specializing in building **scalable data systems** and **production-grade MLOps pipelines** on **Azure** and **AWS**.

I design and develop **end-to-end AI and data platforms** that transform raw, messy data into automated, reliable, and cost-efficient workflows. My work spans the entire lifecycle of modern data engineering:

-  **Large-scale ETL pipelines** and feature engineering
-  **Model deployment**, monitoring, and observability
-  **CI/CD integration** using MLflow and modern DevOps practices
